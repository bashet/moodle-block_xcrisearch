		<dc:description>We've created the perfect conditions for your lightbulb moments.

We've developed an art, craft, design and media laboratory at the heart of a vibrant, ambitious seaboard city - somewhere adventures can begin and ideas can be realised and tested.

It means that as soon as you walk inside the College, you'll sense how central the arts are to society. We'll begin to equip you for your career in the arts the moment you start your course. And this isn't so much a promise about what the College can do for you as an expression of our confidence about its place in the world.

Communities everywhere are relying more and more on the curiosity and problem-solving creative insights of artists and designers. Concerns about sustainability, the connections between the arts and the natural sciences, the potential for crossover between the new media and the handmade are combining to give everything we do here exciting urgency and relevance.

There's a strong relationship between the moments of revelation we want you to experience here and the mastery of visual thinking that we will help you to achieve. Of course, everybody thinks! But great ideas emerge from a kind of thinking that belongs to the senses and overleaps ordinary academic categories and boundaries.

So we're keen on visual thinking and just as keen on its natural servant and partner - drawing. We'll help you to develop the quicksilver thread between eye and hand, and between observation, mark making and invention.</dc:description> <!-- this is description of who we are and what we do - index page text perhaps? -->

		<!--  Level 0 Extended Degree -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>If you want to pursue a specialist degree programme, and have the required AS or equivalent A-level qualifications, but you lack experience of hands-on making, the Level 0 Extended Degree programme will prepare you for entry to our Foundation Degree or BA programmes.

The course is intended for students who have finished their school or college education, or have been out of education for a while, or are an overseas/non-UK applicant. It does not lead to a qualification in its own right, but by providing you with a grounding across a range of art design and media skills, it will guarantee your progress to the first year of your chosen Plymouth College degree.

You will soon become more confident in your use of drawing, visual research, contextual studies, digital imaging and design methods and you will learn how to use a range of materials, equipment and software. As the year goes by you will increasingly specialise in your chosen subject discipline. The aim is that you should quickly become creative, confident and independent.

Extended Degree students have access to all of the College&amp;rsquo;s facilities by negotiation, including its 3D studios, north light drawing spaces, photographic darkrooms and to the region&amp;rsquo;s most extensive and comprehensively stocked moving image production resources.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF FD Commercial Photography  --><!--  FD Contemporary Crafts -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Plymouth College of Art has a great history of teaching Applied Arts and Craft based subjects. The Foundation Degree in Contemporary Crafts* is building on this history, with a contemporary and challenging programme. We have a 2-year full time route and we also welcome applicants to the 3 or 4-year part time options.



The programme enables extensive exploration and investigation into glass, ceramics and metals in their many variations. We have splendidly equipped and accessible workshops. A team of excellent academic staff endeavours to help you develop your design and conceptual skills as well as the practical, technical skills that can be gained from experimenting and practicing in the workshops. A talented &amp;amp; dedicated team of technicians supports practical work.  The programme is designed to enable you to develop your own creative identity.  In the first year you will be introduced to materials and techniques, design and conceptual issues. You can explore a wide range of approaches. You will follow the path that suits you best whether it is as a specialist designer/maker in jewellery, ceramics, glass or metals or you could take a broader Applied Arts approach and develop skills to enable you to design and create objects in different materials. The second year gives students an opportunity to develop their direction &amp;amp; skills, but with further opportunities &amp;amp; challenges such as designing and making for external design competitions and other live projects that come from outside the college. These could be for a large-scale sculpture, working with community or schools projects or designing and making awards.  If you are taking the part time route these experiences will of course be spread over a longer period.  The vocational nature of a Foundation Degree means that your creative skills are complemented by practical work experience and professional studies teaching supported by members of the academic team with experience of working in the Applied Arts Creative Industries.&amp;nbsp;The South West region is a centre for craft based businesses, so there is a rich resource of opportunities to work with practitioners and galleries or related industries.

We also encourage cross-disciplinary &amp;lsquo;dialogue&amp;rsquo; with other subjects throughout the college so that students have an enriched and broad experience.

You will have plenty of opportunities to develop related IT skills both within the course and the college as a whole.  You will also gain a thorough understanding of contemporary, historical, critical and contextual issues that surround the subject and influence where it is today. Our Making Futures Conference on Sustainability within the &amp;lsquo;crafts&amp;rsquo; illustrates that the college is actively involved in current debates and that students are encouraged to work in a responsible, sustainable and ethical way.  Students are encouraged to become aware of and part of external organisations, to participate in and arrange external exhibitions so that by the time they complete the FD and later the BA, they are ready for working in the &amp;lsquo;outside world&amp;rsquo;. Many of our students and graduates are very proactive in this respect.  At the end of the Foundation Degree students can leave to pursue their chosen career path, but most of our students choose to progress onto our challenging and exciting BA year, to strengthen their skills and deepen their knowledge.

All the College's Higher Education provision is validated by the Open University. New programmes are required to go through an extensive approval process conducted by The Open University. The College is&amp;nbsp;required to advertise any new programme as 'subject to validation' until this process has been completed.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Games design at Plymouth is about a lot more than just making yet-another first person shooter! The Foundation Degree in Design for Games course takes the wider view, recognizing that contemporary games technology is used for a huge range of purposes: Education, marketing, military or medical simulation, architecture &amp;ndash; games technology is used for them all (and for stunning, cutting-edge games, too!)



Firmly based on helping students to find work in games design, this foundation degree course has been built from the bottom-up &amp;ndash; what jobs can we equip our students to do? We structured the course modules around the skills the industry needs, covering every aspect of game design from the theory of game-play to 3D animation and using game engines.&amp;nbsp;You will develop an understanding of gaming technology, learning environments, psychology, project and business planning.

As you progress through the Design for Games course, the modules interlink: What you draw, you create as a 3D model, and that model is then imported into a game level of your own design. In the second year your animations can be controlled in a game environment.

Tuition for the Foundation Degree in Design for Games is provided in a variety of ways: Lectures, through studio-based activities and online through a virtual learning environment. You will be encouraged to attend lectures given by practising designers and participate in study visits, external commissions, national competitions and exhibitions. Work-based learning is an important aspect of the course and the reality of the games producing world is built into everything we do.

Career possibilities

Game Designer, Game Content Creator, 3D Artist, Technical Artist, Animator, Character Designer/Animator, Facial Animator/Rigger, Motion Editor,&amp;nbsp;Visual Effects Artists, 3D Modeler/Texturer, Cinematic Animator, Environment Artist, Level Designer.

								<course>

									<dc:description>The Foundation Degree programme engages you in the key roles of a contemporary designer/illustrator developing career opportunities within graphic design, advertising, fine art, artists books, publishing, environmental design practices and the vast array of emerging and new media practices.



The Foundation in Degree in Illustration offers a diverse visually rich image making experience. Students will be encouraged to develop their individual style and identity through diverse experimentation with media, materials and techniques and through an intensely hands on and practical ideas development process. 

Image makers on this programme will investigate the possibilities of working with traditional tools and techniques, and their methods will vary widely: some working with pen, pencil and paint; others will create images using textiles, 3D construction, autographic/industrial reprographics and many will incorporate digital elements into hand-made art. 

Academic and theoretical concepts are integrated into the Illustration programme to give greater articulation to illustrative practice.

Design theory and vocational realism in all programme assignments is further enhanced by provision of a work placement taken in the first and second years of study. Placements and specialist discipline pathways will be in response to, and help to determine, personal career direction.

During the Foundation Degree in Illustration, design research, drawing and image making experimentation are seen to be of paramount importance and are the creative catalyst to inform all problem-solving strategies. The ability to communicate information through illustration is the key to becoming a successful designer/illustrator. The Illustration programme positively endorses the contemporary practice of creating illustrative solutions to graphic communication problems through exploration, evaluation and application of appropriate visual language.

The programme encourages students to take ownership of their learning through the acquisition of time management, scheduling and budgeting skills.

Further opportunities on completion of the Degree in Illustration include progression to aBA hons &amp;lsquo;top up&amp;rsquo; year and potentially, post-graduate study.

							<!--  END OF FD Illustration  --><!--  BA (Hons) Ceramics (Top Up) -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Some of the oldest surviving manmade artefacts are ceramic objects &amp;ndash; transformed by fire to make everything from cups, plates and amphorae to the tiled skin of the space shuttle, and from medical scalpels and musical instruments to bathoom showers and kitchen sinks. That something so fundamental can readily be turned into the finest decoration or the most functional sculptural form means that the art, craft and science of ceramics are enduringly relevant and increasingly experimental.



We encourage you to explore functional and sculptural ceramics and introduce you to a variety of handbuilding techniques as well as to small batch production methods such as mould making, wheel throwing and slip casting. We have excellent facilities including electric, gas and raku kilns. There is potential for cross-disciplinary inquiry and for experiment with digital design and 3D modelling software. The programme concentrates on the realities of workshop practice and makes connections with the community of professionals makers outside the College.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>As well as our progressing Foundation Degree Applied Arts students, we welcome applicants who wish to top up their Foundation Degree or equivalent qualification from other institutions. Even if it is a while since you completed your HND/FD please come and see us. New students enrich all our experiences and give a different perspective to our existing student cohort.



We offer a one-year full time course and a two-year part time route.

You will ideally have a specialism in one or more of our subject areas (Ceramics, Glass, Large Scale Metals or Small scale metals/jewellery). New students often experience the choice of materials and processes in our splendidly equipped workshops exciting, but remember it is quite a short year so if you want to learn new material skills, you will have to put in extra hours to develop them. This is an intensive, challenging and exciting year. Be prepared for the unexpected!

This Programme is designed for students to develop into autonomous, skilled and knowledgeable practitioners. We have modules and assignment briefs that allow you to pursue your own direction, and design your own plan with the guidance of our academic team.

We look at the creative process in more depth and you will have the opportunity to develop a greater understanding of the world you will be entering.

We encourage cross-disciplinary dialogue with other subjects throughout the college so that students can enrich and broaden their experience.

Our Critical, Contextual and Historical studies team guide you through your dissertation, in the contextual module. This aspect of the course becomes an essential part of your experience and is often very influential on the development of your practical work and vice versa.

A talented team of skilled academic and technical staff (all practitioners in their own right) will give you a comprehensive &amp;amp; rounded education, supporting your material explorations and practical work.

Students will also gain a greater understanding of the professional skills you need to develop for when you leave College from our skilled academic team. There are opportunities towards the end of the year to exhibit at prestigious events such as the Bovey Tracey Craft Fair and New Designers, as well as at our Degree Show.

During the year, students are encouraged to be aware and part of external organisations to participate in and arrange exhibitions beyond the confines of the college. By the time they complete the BA, proactive students can already have begun to work professionally. Every student develops at a different rate and the programme is very supportive of all students in this respect, so that by the end of the Programme students should be ready for the outside world.

We encourage students to be mindful of current debates and issues when developing their work. Sustainable and ethical practice is very important to us at Plymouth College of Art and was the focus for our prestigious Making Futures Conference in September 2009.

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Contemporary Crafts (Top Up)  --><!--  BA (Hons) Design for Games (Top Up) -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Games design at Plymouth is about a lot more than just making yet-another first person shooter! This course takes the wider view, recognizing that contemporary games technology is used for a huge range of purposes: Education, marketing, military or medical simulation, architecture &amp;ndash; games technology is used for them all (and for stunning, cutting-edge games, too!)



Firmly based on helping students to find work in games design, the BA honours in Design for Games course has been built from the bottom-up &amp;ndash; what jobs can we equip our students to do? We structured the course modules around the skills the industry needs, covering every aspect of game design from the theory of game-play to 3D animation and using game engines. You will develop an understanding of gaming technology, learning environments, psychology, project and business planning. 

As you progress through the design for games course, the modules interlink: What you draw, you create as a 3D model, and that model is then imported into a game level of your own design. In the second year your animations can be controlled in a game environment.

Tuition for this BA degree is provided in a variety of ways: Lectures, through studio-based activities and online through a virtual learning environment. You will be encouraged to attend lectures given by practising designers and participate in study visits, external commissions, national competitions and exhibitions. Work-based learning is an important aspect of the course and the reality of the games producing world is built into everything we do.

B.A. Hons Progression

All successful FdA Games Design students have the right to progress to a third BA Hons year. This extra year is where you get the opportunity to specialise &amp;ndash; whatever area of the Games design field appeals to you the most, we can support you. 

In conjunction with tutors and industry professionals, you negotiate projects that allow you to grow in the direction you choose, whether level design, character development, modeling or the creation of education and training packages. Alongside negotiated projects, you will also explore contemporary cultural issues and debates from a variety of perspectives, and have the opportunity to be involved in seminars with specialists from sound, fine art, fashion, spatial design, film, animation, graphics etc. This broadened awareness strengthens your understanding of your own discipline and its relation to other areas of creative activity.

This year extends your skills ready for employment within the Games industry, and lets you create a unique, targeted portfolio in the process. it also gives you the opportunity to apply to Masters level Degrees

Career possibilities

Game Designer, Game Content Creator, 3D Artist, Technical Artist, Animator, Character Designer/Animator, Facial Animator/Rigger, Motion Editor,&amp;nbsp;Visual Effects Artists, 3D Modeler/Texturer, Cinematic Animator, Environment Artist, Level Designer.

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Design for Games (Top Up)  --><!--  BA (Hons) Fashion (Top Up) -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>The BA (Hons) Fashion (Top-Up) programme positively encourages and endorses creativity and individuality. The joy of articulating our individual uniqueness and independence through fashion is paramount, together with the thrill of questioning and changing social and political attitudes.



 It has been developed to enable you to explore and experiment with personal design concepts whilst delivering a robust programme of supporting skills and techniques. Areas of focus include design skills, pattern cutting, garment production, CAD/CAM (computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing), marketing and business and relevant supporting IT skills. Students on the BA Fashion degree will also have the opportunity to investigate appropriate vocational and professional areas for future progression and develop the ability to plan and pursue their own career pathway.  Of prime importance is the development of an individual and independent creative identity, vital to a successful career in this challenging and diverse industry. There will be a direct correlation between your contextual theory and your designs which will be developed through a series of lectures and tutorials. This programme of study fosters and encourages the translation of your own research both conceptual and technological and is seen as a vital element within the creative process.  During the BA (Hons) top-up year you will be able to develop your specialist practice while taking advantage of opportunities for dialogue across multi -disciplinary boundaries. You will be able to participate in an environment where you are encouraged to utilise the skills you have previously learned, develop them further and to individually position your creative practice. Many students have found this an ideal course to update their skills in preparation to re-enter employment or as a method to consolidate their skills and obtain a professional qualification.  The course aims to keep abreast of the ever changing fast moving fashion industry and produce graduates who are independent and equipped with a range of intellectual, imaginative and enquiring skills that are appropriate to ever increasing demands by the industry, for the need to turn fashion design into reality and celebrate all skills related to the industry as important.  Recent graduates have gone on to work as designers, garment technologists, stylists, pattern cutters, fashion retail managers, illustrators, fashion magazine editors and self-employed designers makers.

									<dc:description>

The BA Degree in Illustrationprogramme engages you in the key roles of a contemporary designer/illustrator developing career opportunities within graphic design, advertising, fine art, artists books, publishing, environmental design practices and the vast array of emerging and new media practices.

Illustration offers a diverse visually rich image making experience. Students on the BA degree will be encouraged to develop their individual style and identity through diverse experimentation with media, materials and techniques and through an intensely hands on and practical ideas development process. 

Image makers on this illustration programme will investigate the possibilities of working with traditional tools and techniques, and their methods will vary widely: some working with pen, pencil and paint; others will create images using textiles, three dimensional construction, autographic / industrial reprographics and many will incorporate digital elements into hand-made art. 

Academic and theoretical concepts are integrated into the BA Degree programme to give greater articulation to illustrative practice.

Design theory and vocational realism in all programme assignments is further enhanced by provision of a work placement opportunity taken in the first and second years of study. Placements and specialist discipline pathways will be in response to, and help to determine, personal career direction.

Throughout the BA Degree in Illustration, design research, drawing and image making experimentation are seen to be of paramount importance and are the creative catalyst to inform all problem-solving strategies. The ability to communicate information through Illustration is the key to becoming a successful designer/Illustrator. The programme positively endorses the contemporary practice of creating Illustrative solutions to graphic communication problems through exploration, evaluation and application of appropriate visual language.

The BA degree programme encourages students to take ownership of their learning through the acquisition of time management, scheduling and budgeting skills.

The design and making of &amp;lsquo;objects of desire&amp;rsquo; using precious metals and precious or semi-precious stones is riding a tide of exciting experiment that relies on new ways of retrieving, recycling and reformulating traditional materials. Plymouth jewellery and silversmithing students are encouraged to be part of the new ethically aware trend in jewellery design. The College&amp;rsquo;s impressive studio facilities and the close connection between making and digital design media provide a highly stimulating environment for invention.

The BA course begins with an introduction to materials and techniques, and to design and conceptual issues, gradually leading you towards fully developed professional practice. Steps along the way include work placements or internships and taking part in exhibitions such as the annual New Designers exhibition.

								<course>

									<dc:description>

Photography is a wide- ranging discipline leading to opportunities in many specialist areas including documentary, fashion, fine art, commercial, social and reportage. On Foundation Degree Photography students explore a variety of photographic styles before choosing a specialist pathway. During the 1st year practical, conceptual, contextual and vocational skills are embedded, informing an increasingly self-initiated approach in the 2nd year.

Throughout the BA Photography programme, students benefit from a comprehensive range of industry standard resources including film and digital SLR, medium and large format cameras, lighting, studio and location equipment and silver based and digital post-production processes. Practical modules are designed to develop technical excellence in all aspects of photographic craft skill. We also encourage experimental work and believe, for example, that a pinhole camera is as valid a tool for image making as a large format camera.

Our overriding concern is to match technical excellence with creative endeavour. Photography students are expected to find innovative and original methods of making photographic imagery, underpinned by articulate visual communication skills and an acute understanding of the formal elements of art and design; composition, tone, line and form. The influence of art and design and the media, which is recognised as fundamental to photographic practice, is supported by a complementary studies option encouraging experimentation with disciplines outside of the photography subject specialism.

Throughout the BA Photography degree, critical thinking and reflective self-awareness are embedded in practical and theoretical modules. Links are made between formal lectures in contextual studies and the themes explored by students in their photographic practice, encouraging ownership of personal direction in all aspects of study. This integrated approach is further supported by the direct involvement of theory staff in studio modules and vice versa.

BA Degree Photography recognises changing career opportunities and vocational aspirations. Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of photography related ethics, legislation and business skills,&amp;nbsp;and undertake work-based learning to realistically enable them to meet their career aspirations in the arts, media or associated industries.

Further opportunities on completion of the programme include progression to a BA hons &amp;lsquo;top up&amp;rsquo; year and potentially, post-graduate study. 

The BA (Hons) honours year in Photography affords the opportunity to develop and expand your skills. You will explore in detail your chosen area of photographic practice leading towards the production and presentation of a major body of work that will be exhibited to the public and form the basis of your professional portfolio.

During your photography studies you will have developed a clear artistic direction and a strong professional identity. You will have learned the skills and developed the contacts necessary to enable you to pursue a career in photographic practice, as a self employed artist or in employment in the creative industries.

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Photography (Top Up)  --><!--  BA (Hons) Textiles (Top Up) -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Textile Design is a vast subject area with wide ranging creative and commercial applications for fashion, interiors, furnishing, architectural instillations, technical textiles, for use in engineering and medicine and in the production of one off art pieces. This intensely practical course is an exciting and challenging exploration of the potential of textiles. The programme will enable you to learn the design, conceptual and craft skills required to realise your ideas, while not restricting you to a traditional understanding of these practices.

Design development is taught through a series of practical assignments covering contemporary issues, conceptual approaches, research methods and a range of practical and technical workshops. Enabling you to critically evaluate, reflect, develop and realise your practice. Through the programme you will be enabled to specialise within the areas of printed, woven, knitted, stitched and digital textile design.

You will learn skills; techniques and processes that will equip you for practice, commercially, as an independent designer or as a designer maker in your own specialist field.

The teaching team, are committed to supporting and guiding you towards building and sustainingan inventive and individual approach to creative practice. Students are free to express themselves through the design and realisation of: functional work, public realm, sculptural artifacts, installation or conceptually driven outcomes.

A cross-disciplinary approach is encouraged and some students may wish to combine textiles with many other materials and or disciplines. Students are encouraged to develop a strong conceptual base to underpin their particular area of practice. Ongoing input from the Contextual Team will help them to achieve this and to understand the context within which their work sits. Students will also be expected to develop their visual awareness and communication skills via the many possible definitions of what can constitute &amp;lsquo;drawing&amp;rsquo;. Expression through the use of digital technology is encouraged and there will be given opportunities to train in the use of such software as Adobe Photoshop, inDesign, illustrator, 3D Studio Max and basic video editing and web site design.

In preparing for the future students will also be expected to engage with the practicalities of workshop practice, fostering an awareness of the need and means of the day to day maintenance and management of a studio including the protection the health and wellbeing of both themselves and their colleagues and potential employees, through the implementation of correct working practices.

As the course progresses students will be asked to be pro-active in engaging with organisations and people outside the college to generate their own opportunities for free lance design work, exhibitions, residencies, commissioning possibilities and gallery outlets depending on career interests.

Students on this degree will be part of a larger group comprising the other material practitioners across our range of Craft courses. Together you will respond to themed modules in your chosen material practice. Along the way students will gain skills that contemporary practitioners need in order to develop and sustain their practice after graduation and into the world of employment or self-employment. Excellent workshop facilities give the opportunity for a rich exploration of materials, enabling innovative and contemporary practice using specialist craft skills, which are celebrated and shared by expert practitioners.

&amp;lsquo;Transferable&amp;rsquo; skills that give students the ability and the flexibility to move into related areas of the creative industries are a strong element of these programmes.

The themes you will be exploring include: -



Studio Practice

Design for industry

Public art, commissioning, awards and external design briefs

Digital processes, Interdisciplinary practice, Installation and conceptual practice

Sustainability and emotionally durable design

Curation and exhibiting

Drawing development, visual thinking and visual communication

Critical, Contextual and Historical Studies



Underpinning all these themes will be professional and entrepreneurial skills, with opportunities for external placements and internships at home or abroad.

Making has an intrinsic value in our lives. We at PCA recognise the potential of tacit knowledge and the enhanced understanding of the world that comes through our knowledge of material practices. We wish to champion these skills and benefits that are so special and rare in a &amp;lsquo;virtual world&amp;rsquo; whilst also embracing digital technology as another craft skill. The nature of contemporary craft practice has been rapidly changing throughout the last few years. Many other influences have been brought to these disciplines and we embrace these new ways of thinking and encourage the innovative use of materials in interdisciplinary as well as in &amp;lsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; ways. We have highly skilled lecturers and technicians who have a great deal of experience across the crafts disciplines and all are inquisitive about making and its relevance in today&amp;rsquo;s society.

At PCA we have a strong interest in the sustainability of craft practice In 2009 we held our first International Crafts Conference called &amp;ldquo;Making Futures-Crafts in the context of Global Sustainability agendas&amp;rdquo; . This has enabled the compilation and generation of a great deal of networks and research, making sure that we are at the centre of debate and developments in this area.

To be successful in today&amp;rsquo;s creative industries you need to be resourceful, adaptable and resilient. These courses are designed to engender these qualities but also to give you the specialist skills and knowledge to take forward your creative practice into the future.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Textiles (Top Up)  --><!--  BA (Hons) Animation -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Animators are magicians &amp;ndash; masters of the art of illusion. Our craft was born as we played with shadows and light. We honed our skills breathing life into the drawn line, and now in the revolution of the digital age the possibilities for the animation artist are limitless.



This new BA in Animation welcomes students who have an interest in all areas of creative practice &amp;ndash; from fine art, animation and film. The programme enables you to find and develop your creative voice.

The course is based on learning through making. Lectures and workshops run alongside a professionally mentored animation studio. Students from all years take on studio roles where they learn the essential skills of creative collaboration and professional practice.

The emphasis in the first year is on fundamentals such as storyboarding, narrative, drawing and technical skills, both traditional and CGI. During the second year you extend and deepen your knowledge in your vocational pathway alongside developing production management and entrepreneurial business acumen. In your final year you consolidate your professional identity producing your own animation production, either individually or by taking a lead role in a studio collaboration. By the end of the course you will have begun to market and distribute your work.

The animator&amp;rsquo;s skills are sought after not only by the entertainment industry but also by documentary makers, scientific and architectural visualisation, projection for performance, games, education and fine art practice.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

									<learningOutcome>Module Title: Drawing

There is no right or wrong way to draw and there are many different approaches. The way you develop your drawing skills becomes your signature. This module celebrates your individuality through drawing, as well as teaching you the skills of draughtsmanship. It will develop your confidence in a personal response to the world through subjective visualization and expressive mark making techniques as well as teaching you the principles of scale, proportion and perspective required by a more objective approach to drawing is required. The tools we use for drawing will extend from our eyes, hands, and a stick of burnt wood to the digital possibilities of satellites tracing our movements as we observe the world.

Module Title: Sequential Visual Communication

As sequential communication, animation ferments an eclectic mix of art forms, theories and technologies. Creative application is limitless. This module invites you to explore time-based form and purpose, starting with symbolism in the single image and how this evolves over time. You will experiment with narrative and non-narrative strategies and effects on audience engagement. You will also delve into the language of editing and sound, and the part they play in the &amp;lsquo;aesthetics' of time.

&amp;nbsp;Module Title: The Illusionist's Tool Kit 

The possibilities of illusion in animation are endless; this module gives you a starting point from which to breathe life into your ideas. The illusionist&amp;rsquo;s toolkit is a foundation in some of the core skills used for contemporary animation production. Workshops will show you how to bring your ideas to life combining traditional methods and digital technology. The module is split into three themes: The craft of animated movement; methods of evoking space and form; and the skills of &amp;lsquo;compositing&amp;rsquo; - combining different elements such as live action and animation. The craft of the illusionist is to use these skills so that there are no boundaries to the imagination.

Module Title: Inter disiciplinary Experimentation

This module is about the use of animation and illusion in other disciplines. The module provides a playful, hands-on experience of the application of animation in a range of contexts. Workshops will expand your imagination and develop your ability to apply animation to other areas of contemporary art practice or wherever your imagination takes you. You will be introduced to methods of interactivity using digital technology, tricks of performance and projection and mechanisms of Automata (animated machines). Throughout, the emphasis will be on enjoyment, creative risk taking and expanding your own understanding of the possible applications of animation beyond the single screen.

Module Title: Professinal Practice &amp;amp; Personal Development Plannning&amp;nbsp; (PDP)

However technically proficient or creatively brilliant you are, you risk falling at the first hurdle if you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you&amp;rsquo;re going or how to get there. This module is about avoiding common pitfalls and achieving your aims in the most effective way. This involves a process of reflecting on where you are and planning your journey of where you want to go, otherwise known as your &amp;lsquo;Professional Development Plan&amp;rsquo; (PDP). The PDP begins with a diagnosis of your current skills and attributes contrasted with the skills required for employment in your dream career. From this we identify those experiences and skills you will need to acquire during your degree course to prepare you for a successful career in your chosen field. Throughout the module you are introduced to a wide range of related skills and knowledge, including: presentation skills; personal SWOT analysis; marketing and networking strategies; employment and freelance contracts; copyright; working for production companies, health and safety considerations of the workplace and the benefits of collaboration.

Module Title: Complemetary Studies

This module provides an opportunity to expand and develop skills and knowledge in fields beyond the immediate programme environment, in subject areas which are nonetheless relevant to your personal career aspirations, and which have the potential to develop new horizons and feedback into future modules. In order to provide for maximum flexibility and personal relevance ordinarily you will select an elective assignment offered by a discipline outside of your own. Example assignments include: web design, creative writing, black and white photography, underwater imaging, applied arts (ceramics, glass, jewellery, metals) etc.

Module Title: Contexts of Practice 1

This Level 4 module will introduce you to key ideas and theories and will provide a range of critical approaches supporting the investigation, interpretation and analysis of art, design and media. You will study a range of ideas and concepts that have shaped the way that we engage with, produce and consume art, design and media. You will develop core research and communication skills to help you to articulate and contextualise your understanding of the themes covered throughout this module.

Module Title: Specialism

This module builds on the animation skills introduced in &amp;lsquo;The Illusionist&amp;rsquo;s Toolkit&amp;rsquo; module. Now is the time to direct your skills in a more personal direction. You will identify an area of specialisation and expand your technical expertise in this role. Workshops will enable you to develop individual styles and diverse approaches with the flexibility to meet the requirements of a client&amp;rsquo;s brief. The emphasis will be on how to interpret your observations and communicate them through the subtle interplay of animated performance and aesthetic approaches to character or environments.

Module Title: Studio Practice

At the heart of most good productions is an inspiring studio. It is a creative environment made up of equipment and people with creative ideas and technical ability. Employers are not only looking for creative talent but also the ability to contribute effectively to a team. Every year students from the second and third year produce a number of productions in teams. In this module you learn how to make your contribution valuable and be recognised. Pooling skills and resources through collaborative practice enables you to concentrate on your strengths and produce work quicker, and to a higher standard, than would be possible on your own. This module enables you to further develop a specialist skill and gives you the ability to respond effectively to direction whilst developing your knowledge of how to get the best out of team work when it comes to your turn to take a leading role.

Module title: Sound 

Sound is a key tool for the moving image - enriching the visual experience or communicating what is not seen. Sound can enhance an environment, give impact to an action or psychologically manipulate an audience. In this module you will be taught the technical and creative skills of recording and mixing to broadcast standards. You will also develop the creative skills to design evocative soundscapes and produce sound effects for Foley (synched sound to image).

Module Title: Research &amp;amp; Development 

Research and development is a fundamental stage of pre-production that can make or break a project. Key to a successful career is the ability to create innovative and unique work that stands out from the crowd. This module enables you to identify a subject and through research and development to deepen your personal aesthetic approaches. The module begins with a period of generating creative ideas - exploring personal, narrative and socio-political themes - through writing, image making and exploratory research workshops. You will then deconstruct preconceived ideas and work patterns through rich cognitive, visual and technical experimentation. By the end of the module you will have been enabled to cultivate ideas into project proposals ready for your final year production modules.

Module Title: Professional Practice 2 - Entrepreneurial Practice &amp;amp; Pitching

This module is about being proactive in the market place, knowing how to generate opportunities rather than wait for work to come to you. Learning the skills of effective networking will enable you to build professional relationships with potential clients, creative talent and future investors. You will create a portfolio designed to promote you and your work to potential clients and learn how to pitch your ideas effectively to win contracts. In this module you will get out into the creative market place, identify potential opportunities and respond to the requirements of at least one external brief, competition or commission in a professional manner. You will either work alone or in teams as relevant and required by the selected assignment.

Module Title: Contexts of Practice 2

This Level 5 module extends and consolidates the Level 4 introduction to the investigation, interpretation and analysis of art, design and media. Through a series of themed lectures and seminars this module encourages you to make appropriate links between your area of practice and wider theoretical and contextual discourses. You will continue to develop critical approaches to research, which will inform your understanding of the relationship between context and practice.

Module Title: Preproduction

Pre-production is making sure everything is in place for production to begin. This means identifying production needs and potential stumbling blocks before they arise. This module enables you to know exactly what you are doing and how to achieve the best possible results. The concepts and aesthetic style will already have been developed in previous modules, now is the time to make the ideas realizable by testing production methods. Teams will form in relation to the talent and skills needed to make the project a success. In negotiation with your module tutor and peers, you will identify a key role in the production of a project according to your skills and individual focus. You will take responsibility for planning and testing production techniques, work flow and final delivery formats so that the desired aesthetic quality and concepts can be achieved to deadline. It is envisaged that work initiated within this unit is likely to continue into the production module.

Module Title: Production 

This is the culmination of all the previous modules. By now your final project will be fully researched, developed and all the skills and production methods tested and planned -now you make it. The module will begin with a presentation of your final Statement of Intent outlining your role in a fully developed production and how this production will demonstrate your technical, creative and conceptual ability. You will then proceed to fulfil your role as part of a creative team, or in certain circumstances independently, and complete the module with a production that will establish your position as a practitioner within your chosen specialism. As with the pre-production module, you will be expected to evidence your creative and professional development in a variety of appropriate modes, and to maintain and/or extend the professional contacts appropriate to your specialist area

Module Title: Marketing &amp;amp; distribution 

The key to a successful career is not only the work you produce but a targeted marketing strategy. However brilliant your work is, if no one sees it, the professional world won&amp;rsquo;t know who you are or what skills you have to offer. This module enables you to identify your audience and potential employers. Then knowing who your target is enables you to get your work into their hands. Your marketing strategy will have begun to evolve in previous modules: now you fine tune it. Workshops will show you how to create promotional materials for both traditional marketing as well as develop innovative viral, ambient and &amp;lsquo;guerrilla&amp;rsquo; approaches. Your objective will be to fully prepare your production for distribution across a number of platforms. By the end of this module you will have begun to show your work to an international audience, key professionals and potential employers.

Module Title: Contexts of Practice 3

The purpose of this module is to support the development of independent critical thinking and to encourage you to understand and position yourself as a practitioner by situating creative practice within a wider set of historical and theoretical contexts. Working with increased autonomy, you will develop a research project that aims to synthesise the relationship between theory and practice and this will help you to develop critical awareness and an understanding of art &amp;amp; design in its widest context. The intention is to allow you to extend your practice with an informed rationale and to position themselves as contemporary practitioners</learningOutcome> <!-- text describing the learning outcomes -->

									<dc:description>Some of the oldest surviving manmade artefacts are ceramic objects &amp;ndash; transformed by fire to make everything from cups, plates and amphorae to the tiled skin of the space shuttle, and from medical scalpels and musical instruments to bathoom showers and kitchen sinks.



That something so fundamental can readily be turned into the finest decoration or the most functional sculptural form means that the art, craft and science of ceramics are enduringly relevant and increasingly experimental. We encourage you to explore functional and sculptural ceramics and introduce you to a variety of handbuilding techniques as well as to small batch production methods such as mould making, wheel throwing and slip casting.We have excellent facilities including electric, gas and raku kilns.

There is potential for cross-disciplinary inquiry and for experiment with digital design and 3D modelling software. The programme concentrates on the realities of workshop practice and makes connections with the community of professionals makers outside the College.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Ceramics  --><!--  BA (Hons) Contemporary Crafts -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>In the space of a few years, the relationship between the crafts and design has progressed from one based largely on fading tradition to being highly experimental and innovative. There is a powerful resurgence of interest in the qualities of new, old and retrieved materials, often used in new combinations, and there has been a reassessment of the value of craftsmanship as the benchmark of all good work.



The Plymouth Contemporary Crafts programme is on the pulse of all of these dynamics. Its bi-annual Making Futures conference is driving forward the new thinking. Expansion of the studio facilities to create a purpose built centre for the crafts represents solid confidence in their value, and investment in new technologies, which already includes a digital prototyping &amp;lsquo;Fab Lab&amp;rsquo;, continues.

The range of creative practices includes jewellery making, glassblowing, smithing and textile design, and the taught programmes encompass a wealth of disciplines, materials and approaches. You can expect to become fully immersed in design solutions, material qualities and digital production processes from the initial brief to the finished product.

Contemporary crafts practitioners are not only fired by a love of material qualities and making processes, and the histories of their crafts, but also by drawing, narrative development and by issues such as globalisation and sustainability. These crosscutting themes are central to the programme and to the future of craft practice.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

									<dc:description>Design for Games at Plymouth is much more than learning how to create yet another point-and-shoot scenario &amp;ndash; although to be able to do that calls for a tremendous range of skills. Our students learn about the commercial entertainment industry and we equip them to find career openings, but the programme takes a much wider cultural view.



The programme recognises that games technology is being put to a huge range of purposes, for example in education, medical simulation and architecture, and is informing the spread of new ideas about social and democratic design. The meaning and value of games and play are changing and deepening.

We teach the complete design chain from drawing on paper to developments in Photoshop, to making 3D models and adding texture and rig, as well as sound production, narrative structure and character development. You will explore how digital games have evolved in genre and design to become complex experiential-narrational texts with the power to influence how we understand stories and information. And just as the industry relies on teamwork among specialists we will encourage you to collaborate.

Tuition is provided through lectures, studio-based activities and online through a virtual learning environment. You will be encouraged to meet practising designers and to participate in study visits, external commissions, national competitions and exhibitions. The reality of the games producing world is built into everything we do.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>The place of individualism in a curriculum geared to collective social and industrial needs has been argued over continuously since the first Modernist art schools were being set up. And that&amp;rsquo;s just as it should be: fine art continues to be the vehicle for radical argument and originality and breathes energy into all of the applied arts, and vice versa.



At Plymouth we continue to support the notion of fine art as the essential foundation of an arts school &amp;ndash; equivalent to visual philosophy, and represented in frequently unconventional, but always profound, personallymotivated creative expression.

Our twin pathway Fine Art programme will encourage you to develop an energetic and inquisitive approach to your making and to see it in social and cultural context.

The aim is to ensure that as a professional fine artist you will be able to secure yourself a viable and visible position in 21st century society and be able to draw on the range of creative practices, critical insights and professional skills developed on the programme.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Fine Art  --><!--  BA (Hons) Glass -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Transparent or translucent, crystalline or resinous, reflective or refractive, glass has fascinated people for 5,000 years. Silica sand is transformed by melting into a material that flows when hot and becomes solid as it cools. It can last for hundreds of years or shatter in a fraction of a second. And in the hands of a new generation of experimental makers, it is being used in numerous unexpected ways &amp;ndash; in architecture, product design and the fine arts, with thousands of objects and uses in between.



&amp;nbsp;Plymouth is one of very few colleges in the UK with its own glass-making studio and able to offer expert teaching in glass blowing, kiln forming, architectural processes and casting. Still fewer colleges run programmes that encourage students to develop cross-over skills, combining craft disciplines and exploiting points of connection with new media. The programme is based on learning-through-making, beginning in the first year with a general introduction to design for industry and studio practice, and thereafter gradually developing and refining students&amp;rsquo; expertise and professionalism, for example through links with established artists and industry. Glass at Plymouth has a long history of international collaboration. Links with courses in Shanghai, Beijing and Pretoria have been developing for 17 years.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF BA (Hons) Graphic Design  --><!--  BA (Hons) Illustration -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Illustrators can educate and instruct, entertain and entice &amp;ndash; all at the same time. Traditionally their skills have been at the service of commissioning customers: illustrators work to a brief bringing to a client&amp;rsquo;s table imagination and conceptual thinking, along with their highly developed problem solving skills.



Our programme introduces you to professional practice but it also encourages self-directed and authorial approaches which will extend the boundaries of your visual language. And as working &amp;lsquo;outside the commission&amp;rsquo; has become more popular, our illustrators have begun to develop new installation and exhibition spaces, where audiences can engage with their work.

The College offers an unusually rich experience across the range of illustration media and 2D, 3D and digital techniques. The output targets include traditional publishing, independent books, &amp;lsquo;zines and limited prints, through to the range of emerging and new media practices. The course emphasises research, drawing and experimental image-making and modelling, delivered with excellent teaching support</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

The module aims to enhance confidence, competencies and skills to meetprofessional expectations and provide the basis for a deeper understanding andappreciation of the world of employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship.

Module Title: Research, Experimentation &amp;amp; Development (option module)

Starting from the evaluation of your previous work and your intentions for the year, thisfirst module will require you to undertake a period of concentrated research,experimentation and development. The intention is to deconstruct pre-conceived ideasand work patterns, and to allow new creative formations to emerge through calculatedrisk taking and critical reflection. Throughout, the emphasis is on the exploration anddevelopment of concepts, media and methods, rather than finished outcomes. It is likelythat this intense period of research and experimentation will underpin some of thecritical choices made when you map out your aims in the subsequent Creative &amp;amp;Professional Development module.

Module Title: Creative &amp;amp; Professional Development

Following on from the Research, Experimentation &amp;amp; Development module, this unit isintended to support the further development of ideas, processes and media, but with thepurpose of developing these towards finished or presentable outcomes. At the start ofthis unit, the student will have identified their own focus for investigation and explainedand verified their aims through a Statement of Intent. This will be consolidated into aprogramme of ideas generation and practical studio work through negotiation with themodule leader and appropriate specialist staff. The module will therefore help to confirmaims and objectives, and prototype potential solutions, ahead of the Creative &amp;amp;Professional Conclusion module, and it is envisaged that work initiated within this unit islikely to continue into the concluding module.

Module Title: Contexts of Practice 3

This purpose of this module is to support the development of independent criticalthinking and to assist students to understand and position themselves as practitioners bysituating creative practice within a wider set of historical and theoretical contexts. Therelationship (synthesis) between theory and practice will develop critical awareness andan understanding of art &amp;amp; design in its widest context. The intention is to allow thestudent to extend their practice with an informed rationale and to position themselves ascontemporary practitioners.

Module Title: Creative &amp;amp; Professional Conclusion

This module builds upon the students previous achievements to culminate in a final bodyof work for exhibition, and as a platform for further advanced study or entry into theworld of professional practice. As such this corpus of work will demonstrate depth ofunderstanding, creative innovation, aesthetic, conceptual and technical skills, and will besupported by the production of a portfolio of self-promotional materials relating topersonal professional aspirations. Continuing from the Creative &amp;amp; ProfessionalDevelopment module, the student will start this concluding unit by further refining theirarea of investigation through a revised Statement of Intent. This will be consolidated intoa final programme of practical studio work through negotiation with the module leaderand appropriate specialist staff.

								<course>

									<dc:description>This Masters programme is for creative practitioners and graduates who want to accelerate their existing practice, find a new direction or start a new enterprise. It is structured to deliver concrete outcomes that can immediately be applied to your practice, rigorously testing your critical and entrepreneurial awareness. The entrepreneurial landscape is fast changing as we re-define the traditional boundaries, perceptions and definitions of the &amp;lsquo;entrepreneur&amp;rsquo; for the 21st Century.

&amp;nbsp;

The course will challenge your intellectual, practical and creative ambitions by providing you with opportunities to showcase your work and undertake live external projects in arts and business organisations. You will be encouraged to experiment, to stretch and transform your practice with interdisciplinary creative thinking in a real world environment. Visiting lecturers and our network of industry and creative entrepreneurs provide an experiential platform to nurture and nourish your practice.

The course is equally suitable for those who want to develop their career as a self employed practitioner, as a creative entrepreneur within an organisation, or in a combination of the two as part of a &amp;lsquo;portfolio&amp;rsquo; career approach.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF Masters in Entrepreneurship for Creative Practice  --><!--  Masters in Critical Curatorial Practices -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Boundaries between disciplines are increasingly blurred and contemporary curatorial and creative practices habitually overlap. Our Critical Curatorial Practices programme offers recent graduates and existing practitioners the opportunity to pursue a project-led examination of the underlying social and creative trends and, in the process, to develop and put into practice their own curatorial interests.



The course will introduce you to a range of creative curatorial issues, intentions and associated media forms supported by our international, national and local curatorial partnerships. You will individualise your learning through live projects appraised in relation to the matrix of local-global issues, interactions and opportunities that shape contemporary cultural conditions.

The course will allow you to hone your research, planning and logistical skills in a multi-faceted investigative context. You will have space, time and encouragement to explore and develop curatorial processes, tools and models appropriate to your needs.

We welcome applications from all practitioners interested in the curatorial process and for whom the opportunity to participate in a live external projectbased MA is attractive.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

									<dc:description>The more depleted our planetary resources become, the greater society&amp;rsquo;s need for change-making creative practitioners who are equipped to lead the transition to a sustainable culture. This programme is for those who design by thinking and making &amp;ndash; by hand or by digital means &amp;ndash; and who are concerned about the upstream and downstream effects on our human, social, natural and economic capital.

&amp;nbsp;

The course provides you with a cross-disciplinary skill set for dealing with the challenges associated with globalisation, environmental degradation, societal inequalities, resource depletion and over-consumption. You will learn about emerging eco- and other technologies that change the way we conceive, make, distribute and sell, and you will be given insights into the ethical demands of the new marketplace.

The course is suitable for practitioners across the spectrum of design and craft disciplines. We also encourage applications from the applied, visual and fine arts and media.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->

							<!--  END OF Masters in Creative Practices for Sustainability  --><!--  Masters in Contemporary Craft -->

								<course>

									<dc:description>Something fundamental about the act of making empowers the master as much as the student of craft. Craft engages the body, the head and the heart. Our programme is structured to cater for those who share this profound involvement in making and who are willing to take their practice in new directions. Studio and workshop will become your laboratory for research and experiment.



Craft has an important role to play in the transition to a sustainable culture. By questioning and subverting aspects of mass-production and consumerism, the craft disciplines are generating experimental practices that are reshaping ideas about form and function. Contemporary craft focuses on the local, the personal, the marginal and the meaningful.

If you would like to develop new ways of thinking and making or to deepen your knowledge of a specific process, technique or material, this course will support you with a programme of structured research, intellectually bracing theory and innovative practice.

We welcome applicants from backgrounds across contemporary and traditional craft practices, including glass, ceramics, textiles, metalwork and jewellery, bookbinding, print and multimedia.</dc:description> <!-- general summary of the course -->
